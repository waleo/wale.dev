Time

Time is the most valuable commodity \
Time is worth more than wealth \
Time lost cannot be regained

We say we “spend time” or “buy time” like it is a currency \
We measure time so we can monitor how we use it \
We don’t like wasting time

Stop

Think about how you use your time \
Are you on a virtual treadmill? \
Do **you** choose how to use most of **your** time?

Do you have time for the most important things? \
Or rather do you make time for them?

We speak about “making time” though we can’t produce time \
We can only prioritize what we spend time on \
Our priority list is infinite \
We will never be able to “make time” for everything \
So we must choose wisely

Time is the most valuable gift \
Give it without expecting anything back \
So you can find true happiness

Sometimes we receive this most valuable gift and fail to realize it \
Have you been through a life changing event? \
Has unemployment yanked you off the virtual treadmill?

Amidst the emotions realize that you may have received “time” \
Don’t rush back to the status quo \
Take time to choose how **you** will use **your** time \
For it may be some time before you receive this gift again

Time is elusive \
We speak of time “flying away” \
We don’t know where “it went”

We don’t know how much time we have \
We usually crave more time as time passes

I once spent time with an old friend on “borrowed time” \
As his eyes welled up with tears I asked what he was feeling \
He wished he had more time to do just two things that were most important to him

So “take **your** time” to make sure that you “use **your** time” on what matters most
